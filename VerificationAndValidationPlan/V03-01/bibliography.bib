  Abstract                 = {Symbolic Model Checking [3, 14] has proven to be a powerful technique for the verification of reactive systems. {BDDs} [2] have traditionally been used as a symbolic representation of the system. In this paper we show how boolean decision procedures, like Stålmarck's Method [16] or the Davis \& Putnam Procedure [7], can replace {BDDs.} This new technique avoids the space blow up of {BDDs}, generates counterexamples much faster, and sometimes speeds up the verification. In addition, it produces counterexamples of minimal length. We introduce a bounded model checking procedure for {LTL} which reduces model checking to propositional satisfiability. We show that bounded {LTL} model checking can be done without a tableau construction. We have implemented a model checker {BMC}, based on bounded model checking, and preliminary results are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {{UML} 2.0, which is the standard modeling language
 for object-oriented systems, has only an informally
 given semantics. This is in particular the case for
 {UML} 2.0 state machines, which are widely used for
 modeling the reactive behavior of objects. In this
 paper, a list of 29 newly detected trouble spots
 consisting of ambiguities, inconsistencies, and
 unnecessarily strong restrictions of {UML} 2.0 state
 machines is given and illustrated using 6 state
 machines having a problematic meaning; suggestions
 for improvement are presented. In particular, we
 show that the concepts of history, priority, and
 entry/exit points have to be reconsidered.},

 reliability, availability, maintainability and

 based on the system lifecycle and tasks within it,
 for managing RAMS; enables conflicts between RAMS
 elements to be controlled and managed effectively;
 defines a systematic process for specifying
 requirements for RAMS and demonstrating that these
 requirements are achieved; addresses railway
 specifics; does not define RAMS targets, quantities,
 requirements or solutions for specific railway
 applications; does not specify requirements for
 ensuring system security; does not define rules or
 processes pertaining to the certification of railway
 products against the requirements of this standard;
 does not define an approval process by the safety
 regulatory authority. This European Standard is
 applicable: to the specification and demonstration
 of RAMS for all railway applications and at all
 levels of such an application, as appropriate, from
 complete railway routes to major systems within a
 railway route, and to individual and combined
 sub-systems and components within these major
 systems, including those containing software; in
 particular: to new systems; to new systems
 integrated into existing systems in operation prior
 to the creation of this standard, although it is not
 generally applicable to other aspects of the
 existing system; to modifications of existing
 systems in operation prior to the creation of this
 standard, although it is not generally applicable to
 other aspects of the existing system at all relevant
 phases of the lifecycle of an application; for use
 by Railway Authorities and the railway support
 industry. NOTE: Guidance on the applicability is
 given in the requirements of this standard}},
