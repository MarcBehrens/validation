\chapter{Purpose and Structure of the Document}
\label{sec:purpose}

This document describes strategy and plan of the verification and
validation in openETCS. It revises the previous versions (V01, V01.01)
of this document.  This document refers to the process for openETCS as
defined in \cite{openETCS:D2.3a-V02}. It comprises the current versions
of the artifacts ``0-03~Verification Plan'' and ``0-04~Validation
Plan'' as defined there.

The structure of the document follows the distinction from
\cite{openETCS:D2.3a-V02} between the current \emph{openETCS project},
funded as part of the EUREKA cluster programme ITEA~2, and the
\emph{openETCS activity} as a whole, which encompasses the project.


\begin{enumerate}
\item The first part defines (in this section) the role and purpose of
  the document. It provides basic definitions of verification and
  validation and provides a generic description of how to perform
  them.
\item The second part defines verification and validation for the full
  development. In its final version, it shall be a CENELEC-compliant
  plan for verification and validation of the openETCS EVC software.
\item The third part plans those activities which will actually
  be performed within the current project. These are related to
  the overall plan from the second part. They focus on the particular
  instantiation of the development in the project. They define concrete
  verification activities for the artifacts which are produced.
\item A fourth part collects descriptions of methods and tools. Most of
  these are already available from project partners or third
  parties. Some of them are subject to adaptations or even further
  development within openETCS. The second and third part refer to
  relevant methods and tools from the fourth part---ones which are used
  or could be used for verification or validation. Vice versa, the
  descriptions specify for which activity they can be used.
\end{enumerate}
  
In both the second and third part, the \vv strategy, the verification
plan and the validation plan are defined. Verification and validation
share some of their methods and tools, and in some case are applied to
the same design artifacts. Therefore, the plans for both are included
in this document. Nevertheless, these activities are intended to be
and remain independent.

Verification and validation play an important role in the safety
case. This document identifies the V\&V activities which do contribute
and refers to the safety plan for further details on the additional
requirements to be met and a precise statement of what has to be
established.

\section{Verification}
\label{sec:definition-verification}

According to \cite[3.1.48]{EN50128:2011}, verification is an activity
to check whether the output of a development phase meets the
requirements. This concerns the following aspects.
%
\begin{description}
\item[Formalities:] \cite[5.3.2.7 to 10]{EN50128:2011}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The unambiguous identifiability of the artifacts which make up
    the objects of verification, their versions and their relationship
    with other artifacts by the consistent use of unique reference numbers.
\item Consistency in the usage of terms, names, descriptions
\item Formal completeness in addressing all applicable 
  requirements laid down in the process plan.  
  \end{enumerate}
\item[Traceability:] \cite[6.5.4.14 to 17]{EN50128:2011} Most of the
  artifacts subjected to verification must provide detailed tracing information which
  establishes a relation between the constituting items of each object
  of verification and other artifacts, in particular the input
  artifacts of the design step whose output is verified. 
\item[Completeness, Correctness and Consistency:] These properties
  refer to the specific content of the artifact.
\end{description}
%
 The openETCS process \cite{openETCS:D2.3a-V02} requires
verification to be done in each of the phases. Verification has to check aspects of
formal nature and those that refer to the content of the artifacts.

A typical example of verification is the check of a design
refinement. The refined design must cover all required aspects, refine
all requirements coming from the previous design step, and provide
adequate tracing information.  The requirements must all be correctly
refined, and the refined design must in itself be consistent. Though
correctness and consistently are not independent, it is usually
beneficial to address both aspects explicitly. Furthermore, the
refining artifacts must be readable and clearly structured.

Tracing information must be provided by the Quality Assurance Plan
(0-01), the Verification Plan (0-03), the Validation Plan (0-04), the
SW Requirement Specification (3-16), the Overall SW Test Specification
(3-17), the SW Architecture and Design
Specification (4-19), the SW Interface Specification (4-20), the SW
Integration Test Specification (4-21), the SW Component Test
Specification (4-22), the SW Components (5-24), the SW Component Test
Report (5-25), the SW Integration Test Report (6-27), the Overall SW
Test Report (7-29), the Validation Report (7-30).


\section{Validation}
\label{sec:definition-validation}
%\nocite{*}
Validation is name for the activity by which the compliance of an
artifact with the user requirements is checked. Here, this means that
the developed SW of the EVC is fit for its purpose: correct, safe,
operational and fills its role in the EVC architecture.

\nthng{For openETCS, this means that the demonstrator (or parts of it) are
checked against the SS~026 or one of its close descendants (i.e.,
SSRS), taking also further sources of requirements from operational
scenarios and TSIs into accoutn. This will consist of testing the
equipment according to a test plan derived from the requirements and
detailed into concrete test cases at some later stage. Tool support
for validation will thus mainly concern test execution and evaluation,
perhaps supplemented by test derivation or test management. Ambitious
techniques like formal proof are most likely not applicable here.

Thus, the tool support for validation will not differ substantially
from that for similar verification activities.}

One might also consider ``early'' validation activities, e.g.\
``validating'' an executable model against requirements from the
SS~026. These are not mandated by the standards and can per se neither
replace  verification nor validation steps. They may be worthwhile
as means for early defect detection, and may also be integrated into
verification activities, but they are not made parts of the current
verification and validation plans. 

Further (mostly complementary) information on V\&V can be found in the
report on the CENELEC standards (D2.2).

\section{Review}
\label{sec:review}

Most verification and validation activities consist in reviewing
artifacts produced in the development process.

A \emph{review} is 
\begin{itemize}
\item a systematic analysis
\item of a document or set of documents, the object of the review,
\item performed by suitably trained personnel
\item to determine the satisfaction of a specified set of properties
\item potentially taking into account evidential material
\item producing a documentation in a defined, structured format.
\end{itemize}
%
The \emph{object of the review}  may be text or structured text, can
contain graphics, include formal notations of logical or mathematical
nature, may be formal or semi-formal descriptions, programs or
engineering descriptions.

The \emph{documentation} classifies results as positive, negative or
inconclusive with detailed references which items of the objects of
the review and the properties to be checked these verdicts
concern. Verdicts may be required to be substantiated by explanations. 

% \chapter{Document Evolution}

% The verification and validation plan shall be revised in the course of
% the project as the design progresses and gets detailed and experiences
% with verification and validation are made. This is in accordance with
% the EN~50128, where it is required that the plan shall be maintained
% throughout the development cycle.

% \begin{description}
% \item[V01, T0+18:] First version of the plan. 
% \item[V02, T0+22:] First revision (this document), based on the 1st
%   V\&V interim reports on applicability of the V\&V approach to model
%   and implementation/code (D4.2.1, D4.2.2), and a definition of the
%   hazard and risk analysis methodology (D4.2.3)
% \item[V03, T0+30:] Second revision, based on the internal reports on
%   the applicability of the V\&V approach to prototypes of design
%   models and code
% \item[V04, T0+42:] Final version as part of the final V\&V report (D4.4) 
% \end{description}

% \oldtext{
% The first version of the plan was based on the available information of
% the design process. This is not yet very detailed as also the
% description in Chapter~\ref{cha:vv-design-process} of this report
% shows. In particular, the nature of the SSRS is yet to be defined
% precisely, and the architecture description including the HW/SW
% partitioning needs to be revised.}

% \oldtext{Concrete plans of activities are thus still to be made, and methods
% and tools to be applied will have to be selected. Only the first phase
% of V\&V activities is described in Sec.~\ref{sec:first-level-verif}.}

% \chapter{\VV in the Design Process}
% \label{cha:vv-design-process}

% D2.3 defines the openETCS process on an abstract level. It already
% defines the main steps. A slightly more detailed picture than the one
% given in D2.3 is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:openETCSProcess}. 

% \begin{figure}[htb]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{images/ProcessOpenETCS-BeM.png}
%   \caption{openETCS Process (rough view)}
%   \label{fig:openETCSProcess}
% \end{figure}
% %
% As a basis for planning the V\&V activities, the process sketch
% permits to name the main phases. Planning will need a
% better definition of the stages (scope of the design artifacts,
% level of detail, respective system boundaries), detailed planning a
% specification of the artifacts to be produced. Version V01 of this
% document will in these respects be of an accordingly preliminary
% nature. 
 

\part{\VV for a Full Development }



\nthng{
W.r.t.\ \vv, openETCS shall achieve two goals:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Design a tool-supported method with which the EVC software can
  be developed and maintained so that it is suitable for integration
  in (SIL-4) certified products. This will be described in
  Sec.~\ref{sec:vv-strategy-full}, ``\VV Strategy for a Full Development''.
\item Perform part of the development (including tool and method
  evaluation and the study of tool qualification questions) on
  representative parts of the design. The plans for that will be
  detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:vv-strategy-project}, ``\VV Strategy for openETCS''.
\end{enumerate}}

\nthng{
In more detail, the verification and validation have to consider the
following aspects throughout the development process.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item functionalities of the system and the sub-system,
\item system and sub-system architecture,
\item external and internal interfaces of the sub-system,
\item software components,
\item performance and Safety objectives and constraints,
\item functional properties,
\item safety properties.
\end{itemize}}

 This chapter (Sec.~\ref{sec:verification-plan-project}) should have
 been based on a tailoring of the process for the full development
 \cite{openETCS:D2.3a-V02} to the project activities. In absence of
 such a tailoring, which would relate the project activities and their
 outcome appropriately the full development, this is done here for
 each planned verification activity. I.e., the artifacts of the
 project which are subjected to verification are related to the
 artifacts defined in \cite{openETCS:D2.3a-V02}. And for each
 verification activity of the project, the corresponding verification
 activity (or activities) from the Verification Plan for the full
 development (Sec.~\ref{sec:verification-plan-full}) is adapted here
 to the scope and form of the respective project result.
