% \subsection{Model Verification by applying the openETCS
%   Verification Tool Chain (Siemens)}

Siemens will focus the activities on the verification of its
contributions to the openETCS work packages 3 and 7. Currently
available is the MoRC model provided for the primary tool chain for WP
7. This modeling will be continued for WP 3. The existing formal model
will be complemented by a semi-formal model on top. Both, the
semi-formal as well as the formal model need to be verified in WP 4
and will serve as verification objects.

The intention is to apply the preferred and most valuable methods and
parts of the openETCS verification tool chain to the models and by
giving feedback into the openETCS project contribute to increase their
useability and adequacy.

In more detail, these activities are planned: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Support the integration of the MoRC model into the openETCS test
  environment / DLR laboratory.
\item Support the integration of the MoRC model into the RT-Tester
  environment, provided by Uni Bremen.
\item Model based test case generation and execution by using the
  RT-Tester environment provided by Uni Bremen.
\item Determination of the structural test coverage on the model.
\item Determination of the requirements coverage regarding subset-026
  documents, SSRS, implementation model, test model, test case and
  test execution issues.
\item Determine the feasibility of proving safety properties for the
  model.
\end{itemize}
