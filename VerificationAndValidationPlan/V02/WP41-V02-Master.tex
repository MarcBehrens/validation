  This document describes strategy and plan of the verification and
  validation in the project openETCS. It revises the previous version
  (V01) of this document.

  The overall goal of openETCS is to develop the software of the EVC.
  It starts from the specification given in Subset~026, formalizes
  this, provides a software-hardware interface and ends with
  a software for the EVC. This development is to be done in a FLOSS
  style, as far as possible. This goal will only partly be achieved
  within the current ITEA~2 \emph{project}.

  Following some introductory chapters, ths document has three main
  parts. The first defines verification and validation for the full
  development. This part shall eveolve into a draft of a verification
  and validation plan for \emph{activities} which take up the results
  of the current ITEA~2 project. The second part plans only those
  activities which will actually be performed within the current
  project. These will be related to the overall plan in the first
  part, and they will be described in greater detail.

  Both parts also address the issue of tools to support \vv
  activities, which is another concern of openETCS. Details of tools
  and methods, and how they could contribute to achieve the goals of
  openETCS, are given in the third part of the document.
  
  It is planned to further revise this document (V03) after the
  currently planned round of \vv activities \cmmnt{the second level},
  and to use it as a basis for deliverable D4.4, the Final Report on
  \VV.

\bgcmmnt{Some of the revision work needed to be done for this version
  is indicated in the form of comments like this one. Most of the
  comments are missing themselves, though.}

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose and Structure of the Document}
\label{sec:purpose}

This document describes strategy and plan of the verification and
validation in openETCS. It revises the previous version (V01) of this
document.

\bgcmmnt{Perhaps use parts of / refer to the new version of the FPP.}

We distinguish here between the current openETCS project, funded by
ITEA, and the openETCS activity as a whole, which encompasses the
project.

\begin{itemize}
\item The openETCS \emph{activitiy} pursues the vision of a full FLOSS
  development of the software of the \emph{European Vital Computer}
  (EVC). That starts from the specification given in Subset~026 with a
  formalisation of this specification. Then, a software-hardware
  interface is defined and the requirements on the software are
  derived. The final software shall come with a development
  documentation which enables manufacturers to take up the result and
  use it for the construction of their products. This entails that the
  whole approach shall be SIL~4 compliant. The software shall as
  far as possible be \emph{Free, Libre, Open-Source Software}
  (FLOSS)---that is, it shall be open source, developed with freely
  accessible tools, including verification and validation.
\item The openETCS \emph{project} is the current activity funded by
  ITEA.  The project is a major first step in realising the goals of
  the activity. It shall demonstrate that the openETCS vision can be
  realised, and perform some substantial steps towards that
  realisation. The project will define process and methods, select
  suitable tools and do some part of the development itself.
\end{itemize}

Accordingly, the current document addresses, in different parts, both
the openETCS activity and its ongoing realisation within the project.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Following some introductory sections, the first part defines
  verification and validation for the full development. In its final
  version, it shall be a \qq{nearly complete} CENELEC-compliant plan
  for verification and validation of the openETCS EVC software.
\item The second one plans only those activities which will actually
  be performed within the current project. These will be related to
  the overall plan in the first part, and they will be described in
  greater detail.
\item A third part collects descriptions of methods and tools. Most of
  these are already available from project partners or third
  parties. Some of them are subject to adaptations or even further
  development within openETCS. The first and second part refer to
  relevant methods and tools which are used or could be used for
  verification or validation, and, vice versa, the descriptions
  specify for which activity they can be used.
\end{enumerate}
  
Each of the first two parts defines, in different sections, the \vv
strategy, the verification plan and the validation plan. Verification
and validation share some of their methods and tools, and in some case
are applied to the same design artifacts. Therefore, the plans for
both are included in this document. Nevertheless, these activities are
intended to be and remain independent.

The document will refer to the Quality Assurance Plan \cite{QAplan}
for a definition of development phases and artifact denotations. Since
this is currently still under review these references will not be
final and will have to be revised.

Verification and validation play an important role in the safety
case. This document identifies the V\&V activities which do contribute
and refers to the safety plan for further details on the additional
requirements to be met and a precise statement of what has to be
established.

  
\textit{It is planned to further revise this document (V03) after the
currently planned round of \vv activities \fbox{\qq{naming}}, and to
use it as a basis for deliverable D4.4, the Final Report on \VV. The
first part shall evolve into }


\oldtext{
There are three main issues which make this plan different from an
ordinary V\&V plan for a software to develop. First, openETCS is not
only concerned with the software part of the EVC. As part of the
activities, a semi-formal model for SS~026 is to be developed and to
be verified. As the SS~026 covers parts of the ETCS system beyond the
software, also process steps on the system (not just software) level
are to be performed. And in particular the design does not start with
a clearly defined set of requirements on the software.

As a second point, openETCS will not only do development, but
shall also be concerned with processes, methods and tools with the
goal of being able to propose a complete SIL~4 compliant approach. As
part of this, it has to be defined how to handle verification and
validation. This is done in the sections
addressing a ``full development''. Due to the limited resources of the
project, actually performing such a full development is out of the
project's scope. Instead, only some functions will be implemented, and
only partial lines of development will be realised. V\&V related to
these activities is to be planned in the specific sections dedicated
to  ``openETCS''.  }


\section{Background Information}
\label{sec:backgr-inform}

%\todo{Further Info, perhaps put the project context here }

\subsection{Definitions}

\paragraph{Verification}

Verification is an activity which has to be performed at each step of
the design. It has to be verified that the design step achieved its
goals. This consists at least of two parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item that the artifacts produced in the step are of the right type
  and contain all the information they should. E.g., that the SSRS
  identifies all components addressed in SS~026, specifies their
  interfaces in sufficient detail and has allocated the functions to
  the components (this should just serve an example and is based on a
  guess what the SSRS should do)
\item that the artifact correctly implements the input requirements of
  the design step. These typically include the main output artifacts
  of the previous step. ``Correctly implements'' includes requirement
  coverage (tracing). This can and should be supported by some
  tools. Adequacy of such tools depends on things like format
  compatibility, degree of automation, functionality (e.g., ability to
  handle m-to-n relations). Depending on the design step (and the
  nature of the artifacts) different forms of verification will
  complement requirement coverage, with different levels of
  support. The step from SS~026 to the SSRS will mainly consist of
  manual activities besides things like coverage checks. Verifying a
  formal (executable) model against the SSRS can be supported by
  animation or simulation to e.g.\ execute test cases which have been
  designed to check compliance with the SSRS. Even formal proof tools
  may be employed to check or establish properties. Model-to-code steps
  offer far more options (and needs) for tool support. And tools or
  tool sets for unit test will support dynamic testing for requirement
  or code coverage. This may include test generation, test execution
  with report generation, test result evaluation and so on. Also, code
  generator verification (or qualification) may play a role,
  here. Integration steps mandate still other testing (or
  verification) techniques.
\end{itemize}
Summarizing, one may say that verification subsumes highly diverse
activities, and may be realized in very many different forms.

\paragraph{Validation}
%\nocite{*}
Validation is name for the activity by which the compliance of the end
result with the initial requirements is shown. In the case of
openETCS, this means that the demonstrator (or parts of it) are
checked against the SS~026 or one of its close descendants (i.e.,
SSRS), taking also further sources of requirements from operational
scenarios and TSIs into accoutn. This will consist of testing the
equipment according to a test plan derived from the requirements and
detailed into concrete test cases at some later stage. Tool support
for validation will thus mainly concern test execution and evaluation,
perhaps supplemented by test derivation or test management. Ambitious
techniques like formal proof are most likely not applicable here.

Thus, the tool support for validation will not differ substantially
from that for similar verification activities.

One might also consider ``early'' validation activities, e.g.\
``validating'' an executable model against requirements from the
SS~026. These are not mandated by the standards and can per se not
replace  verification of design steps. They may nevertheless be worthwhile
as means for early defect detection.

Further (mostly complementary) information on V\&V can be found in the
report on the CENELEC standards (D2.2).

\chapter{Document Evolution}

The verification and validation plan shall be revised in the course of
the project as the design progresses and gets detailed and experiences
with verification and validation are made. This is in accordance with
the EN~50128, where it is required that the plan shall be maintained
throughout the development cycle.

\begin{description}
\item[V01, T0+18:] First version of the plan. 
\item[V02, T0+22:] First revision (this document), based on the 1st
  V\&V interim reports on applicability of the V\&V approach to model
  and implementation/code (D4.2.1, D4.2.2), and a definition of the
  hazard and risk analysis methodology (D4.2.3)
\item[V03, T0+30:] Second revision, based on the internal reports on
  the applicability of the V\&V approach to prototypes of design
  models and code
\item[V04, T0+42:] Final version as part of the final V\&V report (D4.4) 
\end{description}

\oldtext{
The first version of the plan was based on the available information of
the design process. This is not yet very detailed as also the
description in Chapter~\ref{cha:vv-design-process} of this report
shows. In particular, the nature of the SSRS is yet to be defined
precisely, and the architecture description including the HW/SW
partitioning needs to be revised.}

\oldtext{Concrete plans of activities are thus still to be made, and methods
and tools to be applied will have to be selected. Only the first phase
of V\&V activities is described in Sec.~\ref{sec:first-level-verif}.}

\chapter{\VV in the Design Process}
\label{cha:vv-design-process}

D2.3 defines the openETCS process on an abstract level. It already
defines the main steps. A slightly more detailed picture than the one
given in D2.3 is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:openETCSProcess}. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{images/ProcessOpenETCS-BeM.png}
  \caption{openETCS Process (rough view)}
  \label{fig:openETCSProcess}
\end{figure}
%
As a basis for planning the V\&V activities, the process sketch
permits to name the main phases. Planning will need a
better definition of the stages (scope of the design artifacts,
level of detail, respective system boundaries), detailed planning a
specification of the artifacts to be produced. Version V01 of this
document will in these respects be of an accordingly preliminary
nature.

W.r.t.\ \vv, openETCS shall achieve two goals:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Design a tool-supported method with which the EVC software can
  be developed and maintained so that it is suitable for integration
  in (SIL-4) certified products. This will be described in
  Sec.~\ref{sec:vv-strategy-full}, ``\VV Strategy for a Full Development''.
\item Perform part of the development (including tool and method
  evaluation and the study of tool qualification questions) on
  representative parts of the design. The plans for that will be
  detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:vv-strategy-project}, ``\VV Strategy for openETCS''.
\end{enumerate}}

\oldtext{
In more detail, the verification and validation have to consider the
following aspects throughout the development process.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item functionalities of the system and the sub-system,
\item system and sub-system architecture,
\item external and internal interfaces of the sub-system,
\item software components,
\item performance and Safety objectives and constraints,
\item functional properties,
\item safety properties.
