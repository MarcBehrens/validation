\subsection{Introduction}
In this section we describe our work on the static code analysis of the bitwalker code provided in \href{https://github.com/openETCS/validation/tree/master/Artifacts/Subset-026-7_XML/Subset026_7/Bitwalker}{[validation repository]}

Our aim is to discover programing errors, obtain code metrics (lines of code, lines of code/lines of comments, cyclomatic complexity, class inherance tree and others) and verify some subset of rules defined in the MISRA C Standard.

The code metrics help understanding the complexity of the code and can lead to code changes. For
example, the cyclomatic complexity or the number of paths, are a precise measure of the code complexity, and the more complex the code is, more likely it will contain masked bugs.

Five different static analysis tools have been used during the code verification activities in order to assess the quality of the results and ensure code quality.

Finally, according to the results obtained by using the tools, we will present some conclusions.

\subsection{Resource Standard Metrics -RSM- Results}
In this section we provide the results obtained with the \href{http://msquaredtechnologies.com/m2rsm/}{[RSM]} tool.

Resource Standard Metrics (RSM) is a source code metrics and quality analysis tool.

RSM provides standard metrics and a combination of features that allow to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyze source code for programming errors
\item Analyze source code for code style enforcement
\item Create an Inheritance tree from the code
\item Collect Source Code Metrics by the function, class, file, and project
\item Analyze Cyclomatic Complexity
\end{itemize}

The cyclomatic complexity metric measures the complexity of the code by counting the number of independent paths through a piece of code-by counting the number of decision points. The decision point is where a choice can be made during execution; this gives rise to different paths through the code. Decision points arise through if statements and through while, do while and for loops. A single switch or try statement can also add many more decision points. This metric can either be determined by counting the regions, nodes and edges or number of predicate nodes (branching points) with a flow graph.

The following equations defined McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The number of regions in a flow graph.
\item V(g) = E - N + 2, where E are the edges and N are the nodes.
\item V(g) = P + 1, where P are the predicate nodes.
\end{itemize}

Besides, RSM has intrinsic quality notices and can be extended by the end user with User Defined Quality Notices using regular expressions to analyze code lines. 

Furthermore, RSM tool is mapped to the MISRA C Industry Standard. Taking into account the intrisic quality notice and the user defined quality notices the RSM tool covers 40.16\% of \href{http://msquaredtechnologies.com/m2rsm/docs/QualityStandards/MISRA_C_Mapping.htm}{[MISRA C]} rules

The following table shows the intrinsic Quality Notices for C language that RSM tool checks.

    \hline\hline
    \hline\hline
    \endhead
    \hline\hline
    \endfoot
    \textbf{Quality Notice No. 1}

Emit a quality notice when the physical line length is greater than the specified number of characters.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Reproducing source code on devices that are limited to 80 columns of text can cause the truncation of the line or wrap the line.  Wrapped source lines are difficult to read, thus creating weaker peer reviews of the source code}.
& \textbf{Quality Notice No. 2}

Emit a quality notice when the function name length is greater than the specified number of characters.  

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Long function names may be a portability issue especially when code has to be cross compiled onto embedded platforms.  This difficultly is typically seen with older hardware and operating systems.}
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 3}
    
Emit a quality notice when ellipsis '...' are identified within a functions parameter list thus enabling variable arguments.  

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Ellipsis create a variable argument list.  This type of design is found in C and C++.  It essentially breaks the type strict nature of C++ and should be avoided.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 4}
 
Emit a quality notice if there exists an assignment
operator '=' within a logical 'if' condition.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{An assignment within an "if" condition is likely a typographical error giving rise to a logic defect.  However, some programmers place compound statements into the "if" condition making the code difficult to read.}
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 5}
    
Emit a quality notice if there exists an assignment
operator '=' within a logical 'while' condition.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{An assignment within a "while" condition is likely a typographical error giving rise to a logic defect.  However, some programmers place compound statements into the "while" condition making the code difficult to read.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 6}
 
Emit a quality notice when a pre-decrement operator '--' is identified within the code.  

Rationale: \textcolor{red}{ The pre-decrement of a variable occurs before the remainder of the processing in the statement.  This can be difficult to comprehend or anticipate.  There are documented cases where the mathematical results vary between the result of macros when different code preprocessors expand the macros into a normal form.  Remember, there is no standard for the preprocessor, just the language.}
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 7}
    
Emit a quality notice when a pre-increment operator '++' is identified within the code.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{The pre-increment of a variable occurs before the remainder of the processing in the statement.  This can be difficult to comprehend or anticipate.  There are documented cases where the mathematical results vary between the result of macros when different code preprocessors expand the macros into a normal form.}  
& \textbf{Quality Notice No. 8}

Emit a quality notice when the 'realloc' function
is identified within the code.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Using realloc can lead to latent memory leaks within your C or C++ code.  The call to realloc reassigns the pointer to the same memory address using a larger or smaller space.  However if realloc fails, a NULL pointer is returned.  No "free" was performed on the pointer so if you don't retain the pointer before the realloc call, a latent memory leak could occur.}
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 9}
    
Emit a quality notice when the 'goto' function
is identified within the code.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{The use of "goto" creates spaghetti code.  A "goto" can jump anywhere to the destination label.  This type of design breaks the "one in - one out" ideal of a function creating code which can be impossible to debug or maintain.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 10}
 
Emit a quality notice when the Non-ANSI function prototype is identified within the code.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Older C code can be written in a style that does not use function prototypes of the function argument types.  This code will not compile on ANSI C and C++ compilers because of this type of weakness.  Identifying this condition can help assess whether code can be ported to a newer version of the language.}
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 11}
    
Emit a quality notice when open and closed brackets '[ ]' are not balance within a file.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{This type of error is always caught by the compiler as a syntax error.  However, a compiler can be told to ignore source code by using preprocessor directives like \#if ... \#endif.  This is a way to "comment" out large blocks of code.  However, the code still looks like operational code to the maintainer as it is not a comment.  Many hours can be wasted working on dead code.  This quality notice serves to warn you of this dead code that should be removed or converted to actual comment form.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 12}
 
Emit a quality notice when open and closed parenthesis '( )' are not balance within a file.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{This type of error is always caught by the compiler as a syntax error.  However, a compiler can be told to ignore source code by using preprocessor directives like \#if ... \#endif.  This is a way to "comment" out large blocks of code.  However, the code still looks like operational code to the maintainer as it is not a comment.  Many hours can be wasted working on dead code.  This quality notice serves to warn you of this dead code that should be removed or converted to actual comment form.}.
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 13}
    
Emit a quality notice when a 'switch' statement does not have a 'default' condition.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A "switch" statement must always have a default condition or this logic construct is non-deterministic.  Generally the default condition should warn the user of an anomalous condition which was not anticipated by the programmer by the case clauses of the switch.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 14}
 
Emit a quality notice when there are more 'case' conditions than 'break', 'return' or 'fall through' comments.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Many tools, including RSM, watch the use of "case" and "break" to ensure that there is not an inadvertent fall through to the next case statement.  RSM requires the programmer to explicitly indicate in the source code via a "fall through" comment that the case was designed to fall through to the next statement.}
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 16}
    
Emit a quality notice when function white space
percentage is less than the specified minimum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Source code must be easily read.  A low percentage of white space indicates that the source code is crammed together thus compromising the readability of the code.  Typically white space less than 10 percent is considered crammed  code. }
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 17}
 
Emit a quality notice when function comment
percentage is less than the specified minimum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A programmer must supply sufficient comments to enable the understandability of the source code.  Typically a comment percentage less than 10 percent is considered insufficient.  However, the content quality of the comment is just as important as the quantity of the comments.  For this reason you could use the -E option to extract all the comments from a file.  The reviewer should be able to read the comments and extract the story of the code.}
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 18}
    
Emit a quality notice when the eLOC within a
function exceeds the specified maximum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{An extremely large function is very difficult to maintain and understand.  When a function exceeds 200 eLOC (effective lines of code), it typically indicates that the function could be broken down into several functions.  Small modules are desirable for modular composability.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 19}
 
Emit a quality notice when file white space
percentage is less than the specified minimum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Source code must be easily read.  A low percentage of white space indicates that the source code is crammed together thus compromising the readability of the code.  Typically white space less than 10 percent is considered crammed  code.}

    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 20}
    
Emit a quality notice when file comment
percentage is less than the specified minimum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A programmer must supply sufficient comments to enable the understandability of the source code.  Typically a comment percentage less than 10 percent is considered insufficient.  However, the content quality of the comment is just as important as the quantity of the comments.  For this reason you could use the -E option to extract all the comments from a file.  The reviewer should be able to read the comments and extract the story of the code.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 22}
 
Emit a quality notice when each if, else, for
or while is not bound by scope.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Logical blocks should be bound with scope.  This clearly marks the boundaries of scope for the logical blocks.  Many times, code may be added to non-scoped logic blocks thus pushing other lines of code from the active region of the logical construct giving rise to a logic defect.}
    \\
    \hline 
    \textbf{Quality Notice No. 23}
    
Emit a quality notice when the '?' or the implied
if-then-else construct has been identified.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{The ? operator creates the code equivalent of an "if" then "else" construct.  However the resultant source is far less readable.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 24}
 
Emit a quality notice when an ANSI C++ keyword is identified within a *.c or a *.h file.

Rationale: \textcolor{red}{ In C source code it is possible to find variable names like "class".  This word is a key word in C++ and would prevent this C code from being ported to the C++ language.}
    \\
    \hline
\textbf{Quality Notice No. 25} (Deprecated RSM 6.70) 

When analyzing *.h files for C++ keywords,
assume that *.h can be both C and C++.

Rationale: \textcolor{red}{ A *.h file can be either a C or C++ source file.  If a *.h file is assumed to be from either language, then RSM will not emit C keyword notices in *.h file, only for *.c files.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 26}
 
Emit a quality notice when a void * is identified
within a source file.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A "void *" is a type-less pointer.  ANSI C and C++ strives to be type strict.  In C++ a "void *" breaks the type strict nature of the language which can give rise to anomalous run-time defects.}
    \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Quality Notice No. 27}
    
Emit a quality notice when the number of function return points is greater than the specified maximum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A well constructed function has one entry point and one exit point.  Functions with multiple return points are difficult to debug and maintain.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 28}
 
Emit a quality notice when the cyclomatic complexity of a function exceeds the specified maximum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Cyclomatic complexity is an indicator for the number of logical branches within a function.  A high degree of V(g), greater than 10 or 20, indicates that the function could be broken down into a more modular design of smaller functions.}
    \\
    \hline
        \textbf{Quality Notice No. 29}
        
Emit a quality notice when the number of function input parameters exceeds the specified maximum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A high number of input parameters to a function indicates poor modular design.  Data should be grouped into representative data types.  Functions should be specific to one purpose.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 30}
 
Emit a quality notice when a TAB character is identified within the source code. Indentation with TAB will create editor and device dependent formatting.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Tab characters within source code create documents that are print and display device dependent.  The document may look correct on the screen but it may become unreadable when printed.}
    \\
    \hline
        \textbf{Quality Notice No. 31}
        
Emit a quality notice when class comment
percentage is less than the specified minimum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A programmer must supply sufficient comments to enable the understandability of the source code.  Typically a comment percentage less than 10 percent is considered insufficient.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 43}
 
Emit a quality notice when the key word 'continue' has been identified within the source code.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{The use of 'continue' in logical structures causes a disruption in the linear flow of the logic.  This style of  programming can make maintenance and readability difficult.}
    \\
    \hline
        \textbf{Quality Notice No. 46}
        
Emit a quality notice when function, struct, class or interface blank line percentages are less than the specified minimum
 
Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{The amount of blank lines in a file can indicate the degree of readability in the file. It indicates the author intended his work to be human consumable.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 47}
 
Emit a quality notice when the file blank line percentage is less than the specified minimum

Rationale: \textcolor{red}{The amount of blank lines in a file can indicate the degree of readability in the file. It indicates the author indented his work to be human consumable.}
    \\
    \hline
        \textbf{Quality Notice No. 48}
        
Emit a quality notice when a function has no logical lines of code. 
 
Rationale: \textcolor{red}{This condition indicates a no-op or stubbed out function with no operational code.Many code generators create such no-op functions which contribute to code bloat and unnecessary resource utilization.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 49}
 
Emit a quality notice when a function has no parameters in the parameter list.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A function should always specify the actual parameter names to enhance maintenance and readability. A programmer should always put void to indicate the deliberate design in the code.}
    \\
    \hline
        \textbf{Quality Notice No. 50}
         
Emit a quality notice when a variable is assigned to a literal value. Configurable for literal 0 in rsm.cfg. 

Rationale: \textcolor{red}{A symbolic constant is the preferred method for variable assignment as this creates maintainable and understandable code.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 51}
 
Emit a quality notice when there is no comment before a function block. 
 
Rationale: \textcolor{red}{A function block should retain a preceding comment block describing the purpose, parameters, returns and algorithms.}
    \\
    \hline
     \textbf{Quality Notice No. 52}
     
Emit a quality notice when there is no comment before a class block. 
 
Rationale: \textcolor{red}{A class block should retain a preceding comment block describing the purpose, and algorithms.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 53}
 
Emit a quality notice when there is no comment before a struct block. 

Rationale: \textcolor{red}{A struct block should retain a preceding comment block describing the data and purpose.}
    \\
    \hline
     \textbf{Quality Notice No. 55}
     
Emit a quality notice when scope exceeds the specified maximum in the rsm.cfg file. 
 
Rationale: \textcolor{red}{A deep scope block of complex logic or levels may indicate a maintenance concern.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 56}
 
Emit a quality notice when sequential break statements are identified.

Rationale: \textcolor{red}{Repetitive and sequential breaks can be used to fool RSM identification of case statement without breaks.}
    \\

The table below provides information regarding standard functional metrics such as cyclomatic complexity and others. 

The interface complexity is defined by RSM as the number of input parameters to a function plus the number of return states from that function. Class interface complexity is the sum of all function interface complexity metrics within that class. 

As it was shown previously the cyclomatic complexity metric measures the complexity of the code and it is calculated as V(g) = P + 1, where P are the predicate nodes. 
The result obtained in the calculation of the cyclomatic complexity defines the number of independent paths within a piece of code and determines the upper bound on the number of tests that must be performed to ensure that each statement is executed at least once.

According to McCabe a value of 10 is a practical upper limit for the cyclomatic complexity of a given module. When the complexity exceeds this value, it becomes very difficult to prove, understand and modify the module. However, in some circumstances, it may be appropriate to relax the restriction and permit modules with a complexity as high as 15.

The Maximun total complexity is the addition of Maximun Interface and Cyclomatic complexities and the total Cyclomatic complexity is calculated as the sumn of the cyclomatic complexity of each function of the file. Due to this, a more detailed Complexity analysis per function is provided at following.

Now, an example of the cyclomatic complexity calculation for the bitwalker\_Poke function is shown to compare the correctness of these results .

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[style=acsl-block, frame=single]{./figures/poke.impl}

\end{listing}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics{./figures/flow.png}
\caption{Bitwalker\_Poke Flow}
\end{figure}

In this flow, 4 predicated nodes are displayed so, taking into account the equation V(g) = P + 1, where P are the predicate nodes, we see that the cyclomatic complexity of this function is V(g)=5.

\subsection{LocMetrics tool Results}

\href{http://www.locmetrics.com/}{[LocMetrics]} tool counts total lines of code (LOC), blank lines of code (BLOC), comment lines of code (CLOC), lines with both code and comments (C\&SLOC), logical source lines of code (SLOC-L), McCabe VG complexity (MVG), Header Comments (HCLOC), Header Words (HCWORD) and number of comment words (CWORDS). Physical executable source lines of code (SLOC-P) is calculated as the total lines of source code minus blank lines and comment lines. Counts are calculated on a per file basis and accumulated for the entire project. LocMetrics also generates a comment word histogram.

About the results obtained by LocMetrics tool are the following ones:

\subsection{Understand tool Results}
\href{http://www.scitools.com/}{[Understand]} is a cross-platform, multi-language, maintenance-oriented IDE (Interactive Development Environment). It is designed to help maintain and understand large amounts of legacy or newly created source code. With this tool SQS has checked MISRA-C:2004 and code metrics (lines of code, complexity, object cross reference, invocation tree, Unused Items and others)

The detailed static analysis report is available in the \href{https://github.com/openETCS/validation/tree/master/VnVUserStories/VnVUserStorySQS/04-Results}{[VnVUserStories folder]}

\subsection{Clang Static Analyzer tool Results}
The \href{http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/}{[Clang Static Analyzer]} is a source code analysis tool that finds bugs in C, C++, and Objective-C programs.

The analyzer is 100\% open source and is part of the Clang project. Like the rest of Clang, the analyzer is implemented as a C++ library that can be used by other tools and applications.

With this analysis SQS has checked the following:

\subsection{CPPcheck tool Results}

Bitwalker folder has been analyzed statically by \href{http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/}{[CPPcheck]} tool (Complying with the standard C11).
 C11 (formerly C1X) is an informal name for ISO/IEC 9899:2011, the current standard for the C programming language. It replaces the previous C standard, informally known as C99. This new version mainly standardizes features that have already been supported by common contemporary compilers, and includes a detailed memory model to better support multiple threads of execution. Due to delayed availability of conforming C99 implementations, C11 makes certain features optional, to make it easier to comply with the core language standard.
 
The results of the tool are the following:

\subsection{Conclusions}

Static analysis tools are very good due to the detection of several problem/errors at code level that are usually difficult to detect by manual inspection. Furthermore, they help enforce coding standards and keep code complexity low.

However, these tools sometimes report false positives so it is necessary review them and decide if they are related with problems or not. Nonetheless, it is recommended to complement the static analysis tools with manual code inspections (not thought of by the original coder) and dynamic analysis.

In order to ensure the correctness of the obtained results mentioned in the previous sections, a comparison of them was executed.

As a result of this comparison we obtain that between the tools there are some small deviations regarding some code metrics like eLOC or comments. Thus it was necessary to check how each aspect/metric is defined into each tool. In relation to the MISRA-C rules, as each tool verifies a subset of the rules defined in this standard, the results are different. However, the violations relationed with rules that are included in both RMS and Understand tool have been detected by both tools.

For example, the table below shows that there is a minimun deviation regarding to the cyclomatic complexity obtained with the RSM or Understand and LocMetrics tools

\begin{longtable}{||p{.125\textwidth}|p{.125\textwidth}|p{.125\textwidth}|p{.125\textwidth}||}
  \caption{File Cyclomatic Complexity comparation}\\

    \\
    \hline
    main.c & 1 & 1 
    \\
    \hline
\end{longtable}

Taking into account the obtained results, we can concluded that:
\begin{itemize}
\item the complexity of bitwalker.c file is 13 that exceeds the 10 value so the bitwalker code has moderate risk. Thus, we might split it into smaller modules.
\item there are some misra-c rules violations and quality notice. It would be recommendable to modify the specific lines if it is possible in order to improve code quality.
\end{itemize}

In addition to these, as each existing static analysis tool implements different and very specific techniques (code metrics analysis, semantic analysis, context analysis -interactions between multiple functions calls-, creation of new rules, support coding rules/standard rules, ...) to achieve the required assessment or verification objectives, it is recommended to select different static analysis to cover all the commom areas where problems can occur.
