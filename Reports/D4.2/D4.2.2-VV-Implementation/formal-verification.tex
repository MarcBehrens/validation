\chapter{Formal verification of the \bitwalker core functionality}
\label{sec:formal-verification}


In this chapter we describe in some detail
our efforts on formally verifying the \bitwalker using the verification
tool \framacwp.
The \bitwalker shall read bit sequences from a bit stream 
and convert them to an integer. Furthermore, it shall
convert an integer into a bit sequence and write it into a bit stream.

In Chapter~\ref{sec:frama-c} we had given an introduction
into the most elementary features of \framacwp.
In this chapter we use slightly more complex features of \framacwp
in order to verify key aspects of the \bitwalker functions \peek and \poke.
In particular, we formally specify and (almost completely) verify the
main operational modes of these functions.
In particular, we show that no runtime errors will occur if the
preconditions of the operational modes are satisfied.

After shortly describing our verification method in Section~\ref{sec:verification-method},
we discuss in Section~\ref{sec:bitwalker-first-look}
the use of \framacwp to detect \emph{potential} runtime errors in \peek and \poke.
In Section~\ref{sec:informal-specification} we present an \emph{informal specification}
for both functions.
This informal specification, together with the knowledge about potential
run time errors, serves two main purposes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  It allows us to quickly write tests for the \bitwalker functions 
       (see Section~\ref{sec:bitwalker-tests}).
\item It serves as a basis for the \emph{formal} specification in the \acsl
      specification language of \framacwp (see Section~\ref{sec:formal-specification}).
\end{enumerate}

In Section~\ref{sec:formal-specification} we also discuss several 
modifications of the source code that simplify the verification with \framacwp.

Since our formal specification of \bitwalker is not yet complete,
we present in Section~\ref{sec:verification-results} 
\emph{preliminary} verification results that we achieved with \framacwp.
Finally, we give in Section~\ref{sec:issues} an overview about the
issues that are still open.

\section{Verification method}
\label{sec:verification-method}
\label{method}

In Chapter~\ref{sec:frama-c} we have given an introduction
to some of the capabilities of \framacwp.
In this section we give a shorter, higher-level presentation 
of our verification approach.

We use \emph{deductive verification} in order to 
formally prove that a function satisfies its specification.
The foundations for deductive verification are axiomatic semantics as formulated
by Hoare~\cite{HoareCalculus}.
Figure~\ref{fig:method} shows the method with the involved verification tools.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.60\textwidth]{figures/deductive-verification.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:method} Deductive verification of C code with \framacwp.}
\end{figure}

Starting point is an informal specification of a function with which in mind
an implementation is written.
This informal specification is then formalized using the specification language
\acsl (ANSI\slash ISO-\isoc Specification Language)~\cite{acsl}
that comes with \framac and
is a formal language to express behavioral properties of \isoc programs.
The formal specification of a function is a so-called function contract
which contains preconditions to express what a function expects from its caller
and postconditions to state the guarantees after the execution.

\acsl is the specification language associated with 
the verification platform \framac~\cite{FramaC}
which we use along with its plug-in \framacwp~\cite{wp}.
Within \framac, the \wpframac plug-in supports
the deductive verification of \isoc programs that have been annotated with \acsl.
\framacwp generates verification conditions which are submitted to 
automatic or interactive theorem provers.
If each verification condition is discharged by at least one prover, then
the implementation of the function satisfies its contract.

Figure~\ref{fig:method} shows that we apply the automatic
theorem provers \altergo~\cite{alt-ergo} and \cvc~\cite{cvc}
and then, if necessary, apply the interactive theorem prover \coq~\cite{Coq}
for remaining unproven conditions.
Moreover, unproven conditions motivate to give some extra information
in the form of axioms, lemmas, or assertions in \acsl, 
since these can ease the search of a proof.
One needs to be careful with axioms because they can yield contradictions
and thus make the proof system unsound.

In order to prove the absence of run time errors we use
the \inl{rte} option of \wpframac which automatically generates \acsl
assertions for critical operations.
If all these assertions can be proven, then
the absence of run time errors is guaranteed.


We received the source code only with a high-level description
of what the \bitwalker is supposed to do.
In particular, no sufficient information about error conditions were provided.
On such a basis it is, as pointed out on Page~\pageref{lesson},
not possible to write meaningful test cases,
let alone to formally verify the functionality of the bitwalker functions.

In a first step, we therefore had to inspect the source code and 
derive from it an \emph{informal specification}.
This informal specification is to be understood
as a requirements document for the bitwalker functions as it should have been
available to both the programmer and the verifier in advance.

There are several problems with this approach:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The verifier could make an error while analyzing the source code
and end up with a wrong specification. 

\item
If the verifier's analysis is correct,
there could still be an error in the implementation which would then be present also
in the specification. In any case, only the trivial claim ``the code
works as implemented'' can be verified.
\end{itemize}

In order to avoid these problems we submitted our informal specification
for review by the project partner Siemens.

\section{A first look on \peek and \poke}
\label{sec:bitwalker-first-look}

In this section, we analyze the implementations of \peek 
and \poke.
The goal is to devise a more precise specification than
was originally provided.
Of course, a specification derived from the source code by the verifier
must be subject to a review of the domain experts.

At this point we are already using \framacwp in order to identify
potential run time errors in the source code.

\subsection{Analyzing \peek}
\label{sec:bitwalker-peek-first-look}

Listing~\ref{lst:peek-original} shows the original implementation of \peek.


\begin{listing}[hbt]
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[style=acsl-block, frame=single]{./Bitwalker/Original/Bitwalker_peek.c}
\end{minipage}
\caption{\label{lst:peek-original} Original implementation of \peek}
\end{listing}

Here are some remarks on this implementation.

\begin{itemize}
\item The implementation extensively uses bit operations.
      This is of course largely a matter of taste.
      Nevertheless, it is questionable whether representing a division 
      of an index~\inl{i} by~8 as \inl{i >> 3} is better than writing it as~\inl{i/8}.
\item The argument \inl{Bitstream} represents an array that is only read.
      It is good programming practice to qualify such arguments as \inl{const}.
	Likewise, \inl{CurrentValue} should be declared as \inl{const}.

\item The cast of \inl{CurrentValue != 0} to \inl{uint8_t} is unnecessary for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item The result of expression \inl{CurrentValue != 0} is of type \inl{int} and has either the value~1 or~0.
\item According to the ``usual arithmetic conversions''\footnote{%
     This is indeed the heading of Section~6.3.1.8 of the C standard.
}
this value will be promoted to the type of \inl{retval << 1} which is~\inl{uint64_t}.
\end{itemize}

    Thus, the cast to \inl{uint8_t} is pointless and removing it increases the clarity of the code.

\end{itemize}

At one point, an alternative to the implementation of \peek in
Listing~\ref{lst:peek-original} was suggested.
This alternative implementation, which is shown in Listing~\ref{lst:peek-alternative}
attempts to limit the use of bit operations to a minimum.


\begin{listing}[hbt]
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=acsl-block,frame=single]
  uint64_t Bitwalker_Peek (unsigned int Startposition,
                           unsigned int Length,
                           uint8_t Bitstream[],
                           unsigned int BitstreamSizeInBytes)
  {
    uint64_t retval = 0;
    for (unsigned int i = Startposition +
           BitstreamSizeInBytes*!((Startposition + Length) <=
           BitstreamSizeInBytes*8);
           i < Startposition + Length; i++)
      retval = (retval*2) +
               (uint8_t)((uint8_t)!!(Bitstream[i/8] & BitwalkerBitMaskTable[i%8]));
    return retval;
 }
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\caption{\label{lst:peek-alternative} An alternative implementation of \peek}
\end{listing}

Interestingly, this implementation also employs unnecessary casts to \inl{uint8_t}.
However, the real problem with this alternative implementation is that it produces
different results: Calling \peek from Listing~\ref{lst:peek-original} with the arguments

\begin{verbatim}
  Startposition = 8
  Length = 32
  Bitstream[] = {254, 7, 13, 9}
  BitstreamSizeInBytes = 4
\end{verbatim}

produces~0 whereas the implementation from Listing~\ref{lst:peek-alternative} returns~118294784.
Apparently, even \peek is not so simple that its functionality can be unambiguously
understood just by reading the code.


\clearpage

Figure~\ref{fig:peek-wp} shows a representation of \peek, normalized 
and enhanced with static \acsl assertions by \framacwp.
These assertions can be generated by \framac for all operations where
runtime errors, that is, illegal pointer accesses or arithmetic overflows, can occur.
Green bullets indicate potential runtime errors where \framacwp can verify
that they will \emph{not} occur.


\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/peek-wp.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:peek-wp} Potential runtime errors in \peek}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The remaining potential runtime errors, marked yellow, are related to the facts that at this point \framacwp
\begin{itemize}
\item cannot exclude that \inl{Length} can be greater then~64 
\item has to assume that \inl{Startposition + Length} may overflow
\item has no guarantee that \inl{BitstreamSizeInBytes} is the length 
      of the array starting at the address \inl{Bitstream}
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

\subsection{Analyzing \poke}

Listing~\ref{lst:poke-original} shows the original implementation of \poke.

\begin{listing}[hbt]
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[style=acsl-block, frame=single]{./Bitwalker/Original/Bitwalker_poke.c}
\end{minipage}
\caption{\label{lst:poke-original} Original implementation of \poke}
\end{listing}

Clearly visible in the code are various error conditions that are checked 
by~\poke.
No specifications for these error conditions have been provided.
 
\clearpage


Figure~\ref{fig:poke-wp} shows the normalized representation of \poke
with \acsl assertions that indicate potential runtime errors.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{figures/poke-wp.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:poke-wp} Potential runtime errors in \peek}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Similarly to the potential runtime errors of \peek, \framacwp
is faced with the problem that it

\begin{itemize}
\item cannot exclude that \inl{Length} is greater than~64 
\item has to assume that \inl{Startposition + Length} may overflow
\item has no guarantee that \inl{BitstreamSizeInBytes} is the length 
      of the array starting at the address \inl{Bitstream}
\end{itemize}

\section{Relationship with \inl{boost::dynamic_bitset}}
\label{sec:bitwalker-tests}

While analyzing \peek and \poke
we also had a look at the \CC\ class \inl{boost::dynamic_bitset}.
This class, which is part of the \textsf{Boost} libraries, provides a higher-level and 
easier to use interface to bit sequences than is possible in~C.\footnote{%
  See \url{http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/dynamic_bitset/dynamic_bitset.html}
}

Specifically, we have used \inl{boost::dynamic_bitset}
with the following typedefs

\begin{lstlisting}[style = acsl-block]
    typedef std::vector<uint8_t>              Bytestream;

    typedef boost::dynamic_bitset<uint8_t>    Bitstream;
\end{lstlisting}

to represent arrays of sequences of bytes and bits, respectively.
An object of type \inl{Bitstream} can be initialized with an object
of type \inl{Bytestream}. The type \inl{Bitstream} offers random access
to its stored bits.
In addition, it allows to
\begin{itemize}
\item  compute the unsigned value represented in the bit stream by calling the
       method \inl{to_ulong()}, thereby representing the functionality of \peek
\item  create a bit stream from an unsigned integer value by a special constructor,
       thus representing the functionality of \poke
\end{itemize}

While systematic testing the \bitwalker was not our main objective it proved useful for
the following reasons.

\begin{itemize}
\item It helped us formulating the formal specifications of \peek and \poke.
  
\item It allowed us to quickly detect that the alternative implementation of
      \peek in Listing~\ref{lst:peek-alternative} is not equivalent to the
      original implementation in Listing~\ref{lst:peek-original}.
\end{itemize}

If \inl{boost:dynamic_bitset} did not, as its name already suggests, rely
on dynamic memory allocation, it would be a more suitable candidate
to represent the \bitwalker functionality, than the hand-crafted
and somewhat contrived code at hand.

\clearpage

\section{Formal specification with \acsl}
\label{sec:formal-specification}

In this section, we discuss formal contracts for \peek and \poke.
The contracts are written in \acsl.
Note that they do not provide a full formal specification
of the functionality of the respective functions.
As of now they describe the main operation modes and are aimed at showing
that no runtime errors can occur if the functions are called 
in a context where their preconditions are satisfied.

\subsection{Formal specification of \peek}
\label{sec:formal-specification-peek}

Listing~\ref{lst:spec-peek} shows an \acsl contract with the 
main operation modes of \peek.
We have labeled various clauses of the contract (by user-defined
identifiers between initial keyword and colon, e.g.\
``\inl{readable_bitstream}'').
This feature of \acsl allows us to refer to them more easily.
Note also that we sometimes use shorter names than in the original implementation.

\begin{listing}[hbt]
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[style=acsl-block, frame=single]{./Bitwalker/Modified3/Peek.h}
\end{minipage}
\caption{\label{lst:spec-peek} Formal specification of \peek in \acsl}
\end{listing}

The structure of this contract is as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[Default behavior]
~

\begin{itemize}
\item
The property \inl{readable_bitstream} uses the built-in \acsl predicate \inl{\\valid_read}.
This expresses that all addresses in the range~\inl{Bitstream[0..BitstreamSize-1]}
can be safely dereferenced for \emph{reading}, but not necessarily for writing.

\item
The property \inl{valid_length} expresses the requirement that only
bit sequences with a length not larger than~64 are to be read.
\item
The two \inl{overflow} properties request that no arithmetic overflow
shall occur for the expressions \inl{Start + Length} and
\inl{8 * BitstreamSize}.
In \acsl, an unbounded-precision type \inl{integer} is used
as default, such that a contract formula can't cause an overflow by
itself.

Given the operational context of the \bitwalker these overflows are unlikely
to happen. 
Nevertheless, a formal verification tool such as \framacwp does not
know about the size of ETCS telegrams and therefore needs this information.

\item
The assigns clause expresses that \peek will not change any memory location
outside its scope.
This means in particular that \peek will not have any side effects.
      
\end{itemize}

\item[Behavior for invalid bit sequences]

The behavior \inl{invalid_bit_sequence} describes the situation where
the specified bit sequence does not fit into the underlying bit stream.

\begin{itemize}
\item
The assumes clause describes the conditions to which this behavior applies.
Note that we use the formulation 
\begin{verbatim}
   (Start + Length) > 8 * BitstreamSize
\end{verbatim}
in order to describe an invalid bit sequence whereas the original implementation
in Listing~\ref{lst:peek-original} used the expression
\begin{verbatim}
   ((Start + Length - 1) >> 3) >= BitstreamSize
\end{verbatim}

One difference is that we reformulate the division inherent in the shift
operation as a multiplication.
Also, switching to a strict inequality saves us the trouble
to deal with a potential overflow in the term \inl{(Start + Length - 1)}
that occurs if both \inl{Start} and \inl{Length} are~0.
Last but not least, the new expression is also shorter.

\item
The postcondition of this behavior is that \peek is expected to return~0.
Not surprisingly, we also request that no external memory locations are
changed when this behavior is active.

\end{itemize}

\item[Behavior for valid bit sequences]

The behavior \inl{normal_case} describes the normal operation mode of \peek.
\begin{itemize}
\item
Note that the assumes clause is the negation of the assumes clause  of
the behavior~\inl{invalid_bit_sequence}.

\item
Again we specify that no assignments are to occur.

\item 
At this point the formalization of the behavior of \peek is incomplete.
We only specify the rather weak postcondition that now overflow shall occur
when computing the result.
The complete formalization, based on Formula~\eqref{eq:peek-result}
on Page~\pageref{eq:peek-result}, will be part of a later release of this document.
\end{itemize}

\item[Relationship of both behaviors]

The specification contains also statements about the relationship
of the behaviors \inl{normal_case} and \inl{invalid_bit_sequence}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
The clause \inl{complete behaviors} expresses that
the assumptions of both behaviors cover all admissible 
input values according to the general preconditions.

\item
The clause \inl{disjoint behaviors} expresses
that there are no input values that fit both 
behaviors.
\end{itemize}

These clauses, which support the writing complete and non-contradictory specifications,
will be checked by \framacwp.
\end{description}

\clearpage

\subsection{Code annotations for \peek}
\label{sec:peek-loop-invariants}

Listing~\ref{lst:impl-peek} shows our modified version of \peek.
There are several reasons for these modifications:

\begin{itemize}
\item Loop invariants and static assertions had to be inserted into
      the source code to support the verification.
\item Some shift operations were rewritten as divisions\slash multiplications
      to be more similar to the specification.
\item The loop was rewritten so that loop index starts at~0.
\item We felt that the shorter variable names make the source code more legible.
\end{itemize}

In order to ensure that the refactored code behaves as the original
on we checked both with our test cases (see Section~\ref{sec:bitwalker-tests}).

\begin{listing}[hbt]
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[style=acsl-block, frame=single]{./Bitwalker/Modified3/Peek.c}
\end{minipage}
\caption{\label{lst:impl-peek} Implementation of \peek with \acsl loop invariants}
\end{listing}

%\clearpage

Of course, rewriting the implementation while verifying it may appear odd.
Ideally, the verification tool should take the code as it is.
However, as we have seen when discussing the specification, the
expression to check whether the bit sequence is valid
could be reformulated so that it does not raise unintended run time errors.
Moreover, our refactoring removed an unnecessary cast (see 
Section~\ref{sec:bitwalker-peek-first-look}).

Here are some additional notes on Listing~\ref{lst:impl-peek}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
We added a (static) \acsl assertion that indicates whether \framacwp is ``aware''
that \inl{UINT64_MAX} equals~$2^{64}-1$.

\item
We added the following small helper function for converting a
given ``global'' bit index into a ``local'' bit index that is used for right shifts.

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[style=acsl-block]{./Bitwalker/Modified3/inverse_modulo.h}
\end{minipage}
     
\item
There are several loop invariants and one loop variant. 
The latter is necessary for \framacwp to decide whether the loop terminates.

We mention here only the loop invariant that asserts that in the $i$-th iteration
the value \inl{retval} is less than~$2^i$.
This, together with the precondition that \inl{Length}
is less than~64, is essential to ensure that no arithmetic overflow
can occur when computing the return value of \peek.
 
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

\subsection{Formal specification of \poke}
\label{sec:formal-specification-poke}

Listing~\ref{lst:spec-poke} shows an \acsl contract for the 
main operation modes of \poke.
Again we have labeled some properties of the contract
and use for some variables shorter names than the original implementation.


\begin{listing}[hbt]
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[style=acsl-block, frame=single]{./Bitwalker/Modified3/Poke.h}
\end{minipage}
\caption{\label{lst:spec-poke} Formal Specification of \poke}
\end{listing}

\clearpage 

The contract is structured as follows.

\begin{description}
\item[Default behavior]
The default of \poke behavior is very similar to that of \peek.
The main difference is that \poke writes into the array passed as argument.

\begin{itemize}
\item
The property \inl{writeable_bitstream} is formulated using
the built-in \acsl predicate~\inl{\\valid}.
This expresses that all addresses starting at \inl{Bitstream}
and with offsets in the range~\inl{0..BitstreamSize-1}
can be safely dereferenced for both \emph{reading and writing}.

\item
The property \inl{valid_length} expresses the requirement that only
bit sequences with a length less than~64 are to be written.

\item
The two \inl{overflow} properties request that no arithmetic overflow
shall occur for the expressions \inl{Start + Length} and
\inl{8 * BitstreamSize}.

\item
The assigns clause expresses that \poke will 
write into a part of the array passed as argument.
Apart from this assignment \poke will not have any side effects.
\end{itemize}

\item[Behavior for invalid bit sequences]

The behavior \inl{invalid_bit_sequence} describes the situation when
the specified bit sequence does not fit into the underlying bit stream.

The postcondition of this behavior is that \poke is expected to return~$-1$.
We also strengthen the default assigns clause by requesting that no external memory
locations are changed when this behavior applies.

\item[Behavior for values that do not fit into the bit sequence]

The behavior \inl{value_too_big} describes the case when the
value to be converted into a bit sequence needs more bits than
is provided by the (otherwise valid) bit sequence.

\poke is then expected to return~$-2$.
No external memory locations are to be changed when this behavior is active.

\item[Behavior for the normal case]

The behavior \inl{normal_case} describes the normal operation mode of \poke.
This behavior assumes that the value to be converted is less than $2^{\mathtt{Length}}$
and, of course, that only valid bit sequences are considered.

Since we concentrate on the absence of run time errors we only
specify the range in the bit stream that is to be modified by \poke.
Note that the \inl{assigns} clause describes the \emph{bytes}
that are allowed to be changed by \poke, not the exact bits.


\item[Relationship of the behaviors]

The contract of \poke consists of the three named behaviors
\inl{normal_case}, \inl{invalid_bit_sequence}, and \inl{value_too_big}.
These behaviors are \emph{complete}, meaning that they cover all the input values
of the default behavior.
Another verification goal is to show that these three behaviors exclude each other.

\end{description}


\clearpage

\subsection{Code annotations for \poke}
\label{sec:poke-loop-invariants}

Listing~\ref{lst:impl-poke} shows our modified version of \poke.

\begin{listing}[hbt]
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[style=acsl-block, frame=single]{./Bitwalker/Modified3/Poke.c}
\end{minipage}
\caption{\label{lst:impl-poke} Implementation of \poke with loop invariants}
\end{listing}

\clearpage

The reasons for modifications of \poke are similar to those discussed
in Section~\ref{sec:peek-loop-invariants}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Loop invariants had to be inserted into
      the source code to support the verification.

\item Most shift operations were rewritten as divisions\slash multiplications
      to be more similar to the specification. 
      In particular, we have omitted the helper array \inl{BitwalkerBitMaskTable}.
      This has the advantage, at least from a verification point of view,
      that we do not have to deal with aliasing issues between this array
      and the array \inl{Bitstream}.

\item The loop was rewritten so that loop index starts at~\inl{Length}
      and that no casts to \inl{int} are necessary.

\item Again we used the shorter variable names already introduced in
      Section~\ref{sec:peek-loop-invariants}.

\item Instead of testing that \inl{Value} is greater than~$2^\mathtt{Length} - 1$
      we use the briefer test that it is greater or equal than~$2^\mathtt{Length}$.

\end{itemize}

\section{Results of formal verification with \framacwp}
\label{sec:verification-results}

In this section, we present the current state of the verification results 
for \peek and \poke.
Here is a list of options with which we called the \framacwp analysis in its
version \texttt{Neon 20140301}.\footnote{%
   See \url{http://frama-c.com/download/frama-c-Neon-20140301.tar.gz}
}
For a detailed description of these options we refer to the documentation
of \framac~\cite{fcman,wp}.

Table~\ref{tbl:results-peek-and-poke} lists how many of the generated proof
obligations could be verified by theorem provers.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tbl:results-peek-and-poke} Verification results for \peek and \poke}
\end{table}

In the case of \peek, two out of 72 proof obligations could not be
verified automatically and will have to be handled by the interactive
theorem prover \coq.
The unproven obligations are related to the loop invariant that
states that in iteration~$i$ the value \inl{retval} is less than~$2^i$
(see Listing~\ref{lst:impl-peek}).
In the case of \poke, the two unproven obligations are related
to an issue in how \framac treats bitwise-and operations.

Table~\ref{tbl:results-peek-and-poke} also lists how many proof
obligations were discharged by the various provers.

\begin{itemize}
\item \qed, which is a built-in simplifier of \framacwp, discharges most of the obligations

\item \altergo, which is the default theorem prover of \framacwp, can deal with
      most of the remaining obligations

\item \cvc, which is one of many external theorem provers that can be used with \framacwp,
      discharges for \poke two proof obligations that could be tackled neither by \qed nor \altergo

\item \coq, which is an interactive theorem prover has not been used so far but
      will be employed to deal with the two remaining proof obligations of \peek

\section{Open issues}
\label{sec:issues}

At this stage, only \peek and \poke have been formally specified with \acsl.
Even for these two functions, a detailed formalization of bit operations is missing.
This means, in particular, that we are not in the position to verify that for the
normal operational modes \peek and \poke are \emph{inverse} to each other.
On the other hand, the specification covers already the main operational modes
and provides a good foundation to show under which
circumstances no run time errors will occur.
Yet, there remain several unproven proof obligations for the \bitwalker functions.
These obligations are also related to an insufficient formalization of bit operations.

It is important to keep in mind that the source code was modified to some extent.
The main reasons for this were
\begin{itemize}
\item the need to rephrase some code constructs so that they are less susceptible to run time errors
\item to simplify, from the point of view of \framacwp, some bit operations
\item to accommodate loop annotations and static assertions that
      are necessary for the formal verification
\end{itemize}

\fokus and \cealist will continue to work together to improve \framacwp's
capabilities to deal with bit operations.
Here is a list of issues that Fraunhofer FOKUS came across while verifying the \bitwalker.
The issues have been reported by Fraunhofer FOKUS in \framac's bug tracking 
systems.\footnote{See \url{https://bts.frama-c.com}}

\textbf{ID} & \textbf{Description} \\

0001750 & \framacwp fails to discharge simple bit operation for small integer types \\
\hline
0001751 & \framacwp ``forget'' a proven assertion \\

In this context, we are are also investigating the use of the
\emph{interactive theorem prover} \coq to deal with unproven verification conditions.
Using \coq's rich support for proof manipulation will very likely
simplify the task of discharging the remaining proof obligations.
