\section{Introduction}

According to \cite[3.1.48]{EN50128:2011}, verification is an activity
to check whether the output of a development phase meets the
requirements. This concerns formalities, traceability, and, w.r.t.\
the main content, completeness, correctness and consistency. Within
openETCS, examples of each kind of verification have been
performed. Thereby, also new methods and tools have been evaluated and
adapted. 

Validation concerns the compliance of the end result of the
development with the user requirements. This has been done employing
the demonstrator of the EVC software. 

This document summarizes the activities described in more detail in
separate reports. It explains how these separate activities fit into
the development process of openETCS as defined in the deliverable
D2.3a.    

Most verification activities are actually reviews of documents (or
even programs). For general review activities, a process has been
defined in \cite{openETCS:D1.3.1}.

\section{Verification and Validation in the Development Lifecycle}

\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:lifecycle2} is an overview of the openETCS development
lifecycle, taken from D2.3a. It depicts the process for a complete
development of the EVC software, of which a part has been performed
within the project. Verification, resp., validation, has to be done in
each of the phases of the development.

\section{Overview of Verification and Validation Activities}
\label{sec:overview}

\bgcmmnt{Some sample notes are included in the subsections. To be
  checked for correct assignment to the phases, extended to become
  self-contained summaries of the activities with results and
  contributions. Note: Also evaluating a new verification method is a
  contribution to be mentioned, if this is a side or main effect of
  the activity. Do not forget to add yourself as an author if you contribute.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation in the Planning Phase}
\label{sec:vnv-0}

There have been reviews of the planning documents \cmmnt{compile a

\subsection{Verification and Validation in the System Design Phase}
\label{sec:vnv-1}

% TWT analyzed sub-system requirements from \cite[Chapter~5]{subset-026:3.3.0}. The
% requirements have been modeled as colored Petri nets and subjected to
% formal analyses. This activity is part of the System Design
% Verification.

\subsection{Verification and Validation in the SW Component Phase}
\label{sec:vnv-5}

\begin{itemize}
\item Dedicated tests on single components \cmmnt{\qq{DB}}
\item Formal code verification (FRAMA C on the bitwalker)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Verification and Validation in the SW Integration Phase}
\label{sec:vnv-6}

Automatized integration tests on the SW components. 

\subsection{Verification and Validation in the SW Validation Phase}
\label{sec:vnv-7}

There have been validations on
\begin{itemize}
\item the integrated software within the \qq{SCADE simulation
    environment}, subjecting the SW with a simulated environment to
  operational use cases.
\item an integration of the SW on a reference hardware, applying
  operational use cases.
