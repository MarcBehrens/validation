\subsubsection{Basic Component Verification of Components  Implemented in
  SCADE }
\label{sec:VnV-Code-Basic}


Each component which has been implemented with the SCADE Suite
Advanced Modeler has been subjected to basic verification by the
implementer. The objective of the basic verification is to establish
that the component implements the functionality as required in
standard (non-exceptional) usage situations. This is part of the
process Phase~5, SW Component Implementation and Test. A component
which has passed the basic test may be integrated with other
components (Phase~6, SW Integration). 

The basic test is only a part of the full test according to the SW
Component Test Specification, which requires, among other, code
coverage criteria to be met. That test must be performed on the final
version of the component, and it is to be performed by the Tester.

As an example of the basic component
verifications performed, the one of the component implementing the
Speed and Distance Monitoring from \cite[3.13]{subset-026:3.3.0} is
documented in the following.
