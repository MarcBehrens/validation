\section{\framac issues}

While working with \framac in the course of the OpenETCS project,
Fraunhofer FOKUS identified several issues of \framac and reported\footnote{%
\framac's bug tracking system (BTS) can be accessed via \url{https://bts.frama-c.com}.
} them 
together with feature requests to
the developers at \cealist.
Table~\ref{tbl:framac-issues} lists some of the issues reported by Fraunhofer FOKUS.

We wish to emphasize the importance of identifying, documenting, and fixing of problems
related to verification tools because these activities helps to document appropriate instructions
or constraints on the use of the tools~\cite[\S~6.7.4.3]{en50128-2011}.
