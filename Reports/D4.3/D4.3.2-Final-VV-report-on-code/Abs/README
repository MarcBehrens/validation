Description of demo
-------------------

make  abs.wpgui

	no spec but shows potential runtime error

make abs1.wpgui

	first, naive version of contract

make test_abs

	interesting test results for INT_MIN

make abs1a.wpgui

	sharpened contract that can be verified

make abs1b.wpgui

	minimal contract that ensures absence of run time errors

make abs2.wpgui

	separating specification (abs2.h) from implementation (abs2.c)

make use_abs2_1.wpgui
make use_abs2_2.wpgui
make use_abs2_3.wpgui

	three examples of modular verification

make abs3a1.wpgui

	abs with side effect

make abs3a2.wpgui

	forbid side effect with assigns \nothing;

make abs3a3.wpgui

	selectively allow a side effect

make abs3logging1.wpgui

	detect side effect caused by calling an unknown function
