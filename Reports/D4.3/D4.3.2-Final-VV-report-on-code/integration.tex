\label{cha:integration}

Figure~\ref{fig:scope-of-code-verification} on Page~\pageref{fig:scope-of-code-verification}
outlines the scope of code verification within OpenETCS.
Verification activities, however, also concern integration of the \isoc~code
with the \scade model (see Section~\ref{sec:integration-with-model})
and with the communication layers that underlies the bit stream abstractions
(see Section~\ref{sec:integration-with-communication}).
