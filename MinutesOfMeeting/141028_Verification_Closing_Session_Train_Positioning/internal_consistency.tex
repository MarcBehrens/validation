\subsection{Internal Consistency}

\textit{by Jan Welte and Marc Behrens}



Contant:
\begin{itemize}
\item relations
\item historical development
\item claim of same approach
\item of naming between documents consistence 
\end{itemize}

Are the internal functional allocation and all related input and output consistent?
