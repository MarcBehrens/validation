\subsection{What we want to prove}
We want to prove that the procedure SH\_Initiated\_By\_Driver\_On is a
correct implementation of the section 5.6 Shunting Initiated By Driver
(cf. D1).

To prove this, the same HLL model created for the verification of
SH\_Initiated\_By\_Driver (section~\ref{sh-initiated-by-driver}) is
used except that \texttt{S0} state is not modelized.

\subsection{Results and conclusions}
As in section~\ref{sh-initiated-by-driver}, same conclusions are made
with the exception of \texttt{S0} state.
